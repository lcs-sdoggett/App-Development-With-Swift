 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

let name = "Kyle"
print("I chose a constant for name because names generally don't change")
var age = 19
print("I chose a variable for age because ages change as the years increase")
var steps = 1639
print("I chose a variable for steps taken becasue the amount of steps someone takes changes all the time")
let stepsGoal = 1800
print("I chose a constant for goal for daily steps because a goal is something that stays consistant")
var averageHeartRate = 85.4
print("I chose a variable for average heartbeat because average heartrate also changes frequently")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
